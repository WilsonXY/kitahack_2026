# 🥭 SnapMango - KitaHack 2026

**SnapMango** is an AI-powered nutrition and calorie tracking application developed for **KitaHack 2026**. Our mission is to leverage Google's cutting-edge technologies to contribute to the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, specifically focusing on **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being** and **SDG 2: Zero Hunger**.

## 🌟 Overview

Tracking nutrition is often a tedious and manual task. SnapMango simplifies this by allowing users to simply "Snap" a photo of their meal. Using a **Multi-Agent System powered by Google Gemini**, the app automatically identifies food items, estimates portion sizes, calculates nutritional data and tracks progress over time.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AI Food Analysis**: Take a photo or upload from the gallery to get instant nutritional facts (Calories, Protein, Carbs, Fat, Fiber).
- **Multi-Agent Gemini System**: Utilizes specialized AI agents for classification, ingredient identification, and nutritional estimation.
- **Weekly Progress Tracking**: Visualized pie charts (powered by `fl_chart`) to monitor weekly calorie consumption against goals.
- **Personalized History**: A detailed log of all your past meals with high-contrast, easy-to-read reports.
- **Gamified User Experience**: Smooth transitions and an intuitive, "Mango-themed" UI designed for high engagement.
- **Secure Authentication**: Robust user management using Firebase Auth and Firestore.

SnapMango directly contributes to:
- **SDG 3 (Good Health & Well-being)**: By providing accessible tools for individuals to understand their nutritional intake and combat lifestyle-related diseases (obesity, diabetes).
